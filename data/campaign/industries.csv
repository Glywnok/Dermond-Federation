Time needed to build even a single ship is very high on soely Orbital Works, but if for example you build the base engine parts via Ornium Production style Shipyards, it will cut time almost 7 times. This allows Dermond ships to be built extremly fast and at the same time not caring that much about quality.",3665,HIGH

The reason why their academies are placed on planets may differ and may actually just be that orbital stations are too small for their equipment.

The research station on $market is due to AI or ship research reasons. This academy for example focuses more on AI research and creating more advanced level AI cores. Hegemony keeps an eye on this research complex due to it being the last official AI Core creating facility.",der_researchcomplex,HIGH
