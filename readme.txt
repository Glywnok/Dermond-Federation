I do not take responsobility if your save gets bricked, or if it isn't fun for you.
This mod was released for the test of hullmods and for shits and giggles.

70% of the code was stolen so live with this :)


Special thanks to Banano, willthefunperson, jujutex and ruddy for helping with code.
And Jackundor with Banano for helping with icons.

Oh and also, why do you open sus txt files?
Your save just got brikked! - Probably Lortus?


Also I will remove the music from the mod if the owner will tell me to do so, as long as they don't enjpy the music!
