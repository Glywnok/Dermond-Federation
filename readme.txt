I do not take responsobility if your save gets bricked, or if it isn't fun for you.
This mod was released for the shits and giggles most of the content inside the mod is stolen, but sprites I try to make myself.
Portraits I either try do draw or make with AI.


Most(around 74%) of the code is taken from other mods, if you find which mod takes what code good job! But in case some people wonder from where I took code then here:
DME, ARC, Hullmods Expansion, Tahlan

Special thanks to Banano, willthefunperson, jujutex and ruddy for helping with code, Jackundor with Banano for helping with icons.
And overall Special Thanks to the Entire Corvus, the people there might be retarted but when it comes to modding people are ready to help.


Oh and also, why do you open sus txt files?
Your save just got brikked! - Probably Lortus?


Also I will remove the music from the mod if the owner will tell me to do so, as long as they don't enjoy the music!
If Meso will ask me to remove music I will do so in the next update also.
